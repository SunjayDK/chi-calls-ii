# Getting Started

This project is designed to be hosted as follows:

* **Node backend:** `master` branch hosted on Heroku
* **HTML/CSS/JS frontend:** `gh-pages, hosted on Github pages

And it will require the following resources:

* **Geocodio** for reverse geocoding of addresses. Free up to ~25k hits per day.
* **MongoLab** for storing searches. A free sandbox account should be sufficient for this; if not, it's still kind of cheap.
* **Heroku and Github** accounts for hosting. Should run just fine (but a little slow) on a free Heroku account.
